# HR Application
## This is The system of accounting of employees and generation of personnel documents.

This assignment was done in order to show that Nursultan Khaimuldin can take me for a thesis.

So, current progress is:

A simple crud has been implemented for some tables, swagger is enabled, JWT tokens and authentication access settings (accesses are made just for example).

### Application stack:Java Spring Boot, Postgresql, Flyway, Jpa, Swagger.

In fact, I could have implemented much more functionality, but given that I had pairs and tasks, 
I only had a day to implement this functionality, and this is my first project on a Sping Boot so I had to read a lot of documentation.

## Some additional info

Services, controllers, entities, DTO's(which are not fully completed yet), and JPA repositories were used for development 
(I didn't have to write additional functions at this stage, but there are a couple of examples in the code).
Thymeleaf was not used due to the tight deadlines and too small a project volume.

### Just a little info about me

I am currently on the 3rd course, SE. Work as a backend/fullstack for 3+ years. My main language is Python, but I often work with JS, PHP 
and had 3 month experience with C# and .NET on my internship in BTS
